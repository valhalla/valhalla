Meili, provides a set of algorithms and datastructures for map matching. It matches a sequence of locations (usually noisy e.g. GPS trajectory) to the underlying road network. In keeping with the Norse mythological theme, the name [Meili](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meili), Thor's brother, was chosen. Since map matching is closely related to routing and since Thor is the Valhalla routing library, meili seemed most appropriate. Additionally the main author of this software, @ptpt from team [Mapillary](https://github.com/mapillary)  noted that, mĕilì (美丽) means beautiful in Chinese. This is indeed a beautiful collaboration between team Mapillary and team Valhalla! Open source FTW!
