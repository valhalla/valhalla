# Skadi

Skadi can be used to access digital elevation model (DEM) data which is useful in computing steepness of edges in the route graph or generating an elevation profile along a computed route.

Skadi is essentially a set of various data structures and algorithms which deal with things like: sampling elevation data in an adhoc or evenly sampled manner as well as serving elevation data in structured (json) or raw (geotiff) formats.
