# Mjolnir

The mjolnir is essentially a set of applications, data structures and algorithms which deal with things like: parsing OSM data extracts, cutting routable "graph" tiles, generating tile hierarchies and testing for data deficiencies.  This tiled routing data is used in routing and searching under the valhalla organization.
