# Tyr

Tyr is a service layer taking locations and options as input and returning a route and maneuvers as output essentially linking together all other projects under the valhalla organization. Tyr is essentially a set of various data structures and algorithms which deal with things like: data marshalling, http, request parsing, response serializing, and  interprocess communication.
