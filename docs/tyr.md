# Tyr

Tyr is a service layer taking locations and options as input and returning a route and maneuvers as output essentially linking together all other projects under the valhalla organization. In keeping with the Norse mythological theme, the name Tyr was chosen as backcronym standing for: Take Your Route. Since this software deals mostly with providing routes based on http requests, this seemed like a fitting name! Tyr is essentially a set of various data structures and algorithms which deal with things like: data marshalling, http, request parsing, response serializing, and  interprocess communication.
