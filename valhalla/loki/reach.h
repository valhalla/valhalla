// NOTE: another approach is possible which would still allow for one-at-a-time look up. In this case
// we could actually keep the tree from the previous expansion and as soon as the tree from the next
// expansion intersects it we could merge the two and continue. To make that work we'd need to remove
// the part of the expansion that isn't relevant to the current expansion and re-sort the edge set.
// That would not be an easy task. Instead we could just use the intersection as a short circuit to
// terminate the expansion if the threshold has been met. The problem here is one of diminishing
// returns. Which expansion do you keep around for performing the intersections. Surely not all of
// them, so the question is which ones. The first one may not be relevant for the second one but may
// be for the 3rd one. The trick is we dont keep any of them around, instead we just remember the
// the outcomes for any edges that we touched. Specifically we keep a set of edge ids we found to be
// reachable. We can use this information to shortcut the current expansion when it intersects these
// edges. If you are searching outbound and hit an edge that is reachabile outbound then you can stop
// and claim reachable outbound. The same works for the inbound direction. Sadly you cannot use
// previously found unreachable edges to shortcut a search as they could be local minima (just a
// branch) of your current search tree
